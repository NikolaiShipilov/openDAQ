 * Is itself a Property object - `"AuthenticationMethod"` is a Selection property whose candidates are the
 * supported methods' own ids, as plain strings (the real `IAuthenticationMethod` objects themselves - fields
 * and all - are reachable via `getSupportedAuthenticationMethods()`, keyed by that same id).
 * A directly-supplied credential is carried as a `"SuppliedCredential"` property - a dictionary of field
 * value(s), keyed by their own field id (see `ICredentialField::getId`); its default value is an empty
 * dictionary, which means "none supplied" (the module asks the registered credential provider instead). A
 * non-empty value counts as supplied, and must carry a non-empty value for every field the currently selected
 * `"AuthenticationMethod"` marks required (see `ICredentialField::isRequired`) - a write that doesn't is
 * rejected. Changing `"AuthenticationMethod"` unconditionally resets `"SuppliedCredential"` back to empty.
 * The typed getters/setters below are an equal, typed alternative to tuning the
 * config through these properties directly - a caller can customize it either way, entirely through
 * `IAuthenticationConfig` itself or entirely through the generic `IPropertyObject` interface this object also
 * implements; `"SuppliedCredential"` and `"AuthenticationMethod"` can both equally be read and set through
 * either.
